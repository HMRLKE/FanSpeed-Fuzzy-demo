# FanSpeed-Fuzzy-demo
Demo of a Fuzzy Logic-based CPU Fan Speed Controller

The aim is to control the CPU Fan Speed based on the system's current core temperature (in degrees Celsius) and current clock speed (in GHz).

The ranges used are calibrated based on the current computer models, thus these ranges are subject to change as time pass by. The ranges are as follows:

| Fuzzy Variables | Units | Ranges (based on 2016 computer models) |
|-|-|-|
| Core temperature | degrees Celsius (Â°C) | 0 to 100 |
| Clock speed frequency | Gigahertz (GHz) | 0 to 4 |
| Fan speed | Revolutions per minute (RPM) | 0 to 6000 |

## Fuzzy Rules

| Core Temperature | | Clock Speed | | Fan Speed |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| cold | AND | low | THEN | slow |
| cold | AND | normal | THEN | slow |
| cold | AND | turbo | THEN | fast |
| warm | AND | low | THEN | slow |
| warm | AND | normal | THEN | slow |
| warm | AND | turbo | THEN | fast |
| hot | AND | low | THEN | fast |
| hot | AND | normal | THEN | fast |
| hot | AND | turbo | THEN | fast |
